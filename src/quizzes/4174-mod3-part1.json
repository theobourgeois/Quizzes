    "answers": [
      "They can filter application-specific commands such as HTTP GET vs HTTP PUT",
      "They work at all OSI layers, ensuring deep packet inspection",
      "They can be bypassed using address spoofing techniques",
      "They provide built-in encryption for all transmitted data"

  {
    "question": "Why can address spoofing compromise the effectiveness of packet filtering?",
    "answers": [
      "Packet filtering only verifies the destination address, not the source address",
      "Spoofed packets can bypass ACL rules by pretending to come from a trusted source",
      "Packet filtering relies entirely on MAC addresses, which can be easily changed",
      "Spoofing allows attackers to bypass firewalls and gain administrator privileges automatically"
