      "The server responds with a RST packet, terminating the connection",
      "The server waits indefinitely, causing a system freeze",
      "The server holds half-open connections, eventually exhausting resources",

  {
    "question": "How does a botnet-based DoS attack differ from a traditional DoS attack?",
    "answers": [
      "It uses multiple compromised devices to launch a coordinated attack",
      "It targets only web applications, unlike traditional DoS attacks",
      "It is designed to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in network hardware",
