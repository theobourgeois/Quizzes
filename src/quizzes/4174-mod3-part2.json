  {
    "question": "Why is a Screened Host Firewall considered to have high flexibility but low security?",
    "answers": [
      "Because the Bastion Host is on the same network segment as private hosts, allowing potential direct access to the internet",
      "Because it uses multiple routers to segment the network",
      "Because all traffic must pass through the BH before reaching private hosts",
      "Because it uses dual network interfaces to enforce strict traffic flow control"

    "correctAnswer": 0
  },
  {
    "question": "In a Dual-Homed Gateway Firewall configuration, why are information servers placed outside the Bastion Host?",
    "answers": [
      "To provide better access to internal users",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of a Screened Subnet Gateway Firewall over a Dual-Homed Gateway Firewall?",
    "answers": [
      "It uses a single router for filtering traffic",
      "It eliminates the need for a Bastion Host",
      "It creates a DMZ (de-militarized zone) using two routers for improved security and flexibility",
      "It allows direct communication between the private network and external networks"

  {
    "question": "Which of the following rules applies to the INNER router (R1) in a Screened Subnet Firewall configuration?",

  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of Network Address Translation (NAT) in a firewall gateway?",
    "answers": [
      "To allow direct communication between internal and external hosts",
      "To translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses for security and address preservation",
      "To act as a proxy for filtering application-level traffic",
      "To dynamically assign IP addresses within the internal network"

      "Dynamic Many-to-1 NAT (PAT)",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is Static (1-1) NAT considered the least efficient in terms of address preservation?",
    "answers": [
      "Because it requires a unique public IP for each internal host",
      "Because it constantly changes the mapping table",
      "Because it relies on client port numbers for address translation",
      "Because it does not allow internal servers to be accessed from external networks"

    "correctAnswer": 0
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a major limitation of Dynamic Many-to-a-Pool NAT?",
    "answers": [
      "It requires each internal host to have a unique public IP address",
      "It allows only a limited number of clients to connect to outside servers at any given time",
      "It prevents internal servers from being accessible externally",
      "It does not support outbound traffic translation"

    "correctAnswer": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Dynamic Many-to-1 NAT (PAT) handle multiple simultaneous connections?",
    "answers": [
      "By assigning a unique public IP address to each internal host",
      "By using both client port numbers and IP addresses for mapping",
      "By allowing each internal host to directly request a public IP address",
      "By creating a fixed mapping table that does not change over time"

  },
  {
    "question": "In a Dual-Homed Gateway Firewall, what is the primary role of the packet filtering router?",
